	  <h1>Code Of Conduct</h1>




<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Privacy Toronto is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion, immigration status, or any other grounds. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form.</p>

<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave humanly. Harassment and bigoted or exclusionary comments are not tolerated, and individuals violating these rules may be asked to leave our events at the sole discretion of the event organizers.</p>

<p>More information is available below. Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming event for all.</p>

<h2 id="communication-guidelines">Communication Guidelines</h2>

<p>Here are some guidelines on how to communicate during our events :</p>

<ol>
<li>Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.</li>
<li>Be an active listener. Our events are conducted in English; be appreciative of people who may be speaking their second (or third, or fifth!) language.</li>
<li>Avoid jargon. Assume that people don’t all use the same terms, and explain them.</li>
<li>Be concise. Leave room for others to participate.</li>
<li>Avoid making assumptions about others when communicating, including assumptions about gender or pronoun choice, lived experience, or tech expertise.</li>
<li>Disagreement is normal, but respect is key. Address the idea, don’t attack the person.</li>
<li>Your choices may not be everyone&rsquo;s choices. There is space for different devices, software, tools, operating systems, programming languages, and licenses, as well as different philosophies and strategies. Focus discussions on the needs of users.</li>
<li>We are all learning, and we may make mistakes. Being able to acknowledge, apologize, and move on with new awareness will help keep our group open to all.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not sure, just ask.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="further-resources">Further resources</h2>

<p>Our code of conduct is a work in progress, and we gratefully acknowledge all the work that is being done on this topic.</p>

<p>The essential goal is to make sure everyone feels welcome and acknowledged. If you have suggestions or want to help us improve our code (or anything else about our meetings), or links we should add below, please get in touch.</p>
