	  <h1>Code Of Conduct</h1>




<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Privacy Toronto is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.</p>

<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave humanly. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate in our events.</p>

<p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the event organizers.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

<h2 id="guide-on-how-to-communicate">Guide on how to communicate</h2>

<p>Here are some guidelines on how to communicate during our events :</p>

<ol>
<li>Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.</li>
<li>Be an active listener, and be patient with people who are speaking their second (or third, or fifth!) language.</li>
<li>Avoid jargon. Assume that people don’t use the same terms, and explain them.</li>
<li>Address the idea, don’t attack the person.</li>
<li>Your personal choice of technology doesn’t fit all users’ needs. There is space for different devices, software, tools, operating systems, programming languages, and licenses. Focus discussions on tools, whether closed source and commercially supported or open source, on the needs of users.</li>
<li>If you do not like a solution someone else is proposing, explain why, and state an alternative.</li>
</ol>
