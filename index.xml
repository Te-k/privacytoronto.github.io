      <description>Privacy Discussions in Toronto is a group which aims at increasing awareness of everyone about Privacy and Security. We think that privacy and security are new challenges in our quickly evolving society and that everyone should have enough knowledge to take informed decisions.
We are organising discussions around privacy in Toronto that we want accessible to everyone, as a place to share our concerns and learn from each other. We especially want to open this discussions to minorities (wether because of their origin, gender or sexual orientation) who are more likely to be at risk of digital threats than anyone.</description>
